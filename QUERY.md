> `ref`: a globally unique *identifier*, often represented as a pointer to the place (page, position) in your space where the object is defined. For instance, a *page* object will use the page name as its `ref` attribute, and a `task` will use `page@pos` (where `pos` is the location the task appears in `page`).
