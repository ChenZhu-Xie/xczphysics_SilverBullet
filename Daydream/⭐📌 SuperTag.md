#Tana #SuperTag 

There are certain product-design philosophies at play: 

for example, one may regard a #Tag as an uninstantiated class, 
with any object marked by that #Tag functioning as an instance that inherits the class’s attributes or fields (whose values may be generated automatically from its content).

SB is lightweight, and at present its tags and attributes remain decoupled. 



These ideas certainly invite further discussion.
